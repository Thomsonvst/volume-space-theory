# volume-space-theory
The Volume-Space Theory (VST) is a novel hypothesis that proposes a radical re-conceptualization of spatial volume itself, aiming to address some
profound challenges. Unlike conventional models where space is often treated as a passive backdrop, VST posits that spatial volume is a dynamic, active
medium, fundamentally influenced by and generated from matter and energy. This framework introduces a new mechanism for cosmic expansion that doesnâ€™t
rely on hypothetical dark energy, and offers a fresh perspective on the information paradox by suggesting how information might be preserved through the
inherent creation of space, it also explores other challenges.
